				"Artificial Intelligence Foundation and Pre-trained Models: Fundamentals, Applications, Opportunities, and Social Impacts" 
				<br>
				by Adam Kolides, Alyna Nawaz, Anshu Rathor, Denzel Beeman, Muzammil Hashmi, Sana
Fatima, David Berdik, Mahmoud Al-Ayyoub, Yaser Jararweh
				<br>
				<!--Abstract: With the emergence of foundation models (FMs) that are trained on large amounts of data at
	scale and adaptable to a wide range of downstream applications, AI is experiencing a paradigm
	revolution. BERT, T5, ChatGPT, GPT-3, Codex, DALL-E, Whisper, and CLIP are now the
	foundation for new applications ranging from computer vision to protein sequence study and from
	to speech recognition to coding. Earlier models had a reputation of starting from scratch with
	each new challenge. The capacity to experiment with, examine, and comprehend the capabilities
	and potentials of next-generation FMs is critical to undertaking this research and guiding its
	path. Nevertheless, these models are currently inaccessible as the resources required to train these
	models are highly concentrated in industry, and even the assets (data, code) required to replicate
	their training are frequently not released due to their demand in the real-time industry. At the
	moment, only large tech companies such as OpenAI, Google, Facebook, and Baidu can afford to
	construct FMs. We attempt to analyze and examine the main capabilities, key implementations,
	technological fundamentals, and socially constructed possible consequences of these models inside
	this research. Despite the expected widely publicized use of FMs, we still lack a comprehensive
	knowledge of how they operate, why they underperform, and what they are even capable of because
	of their emerging global qualities. To deal with these problems, we believe that much critical
	research on FMs would necessitate extensive multidisciplinary collaboration, given their essentially
	social and technical structure. Throughout the investigation, we will also have to deal with the
	problem of misrepresentation created by these systems. If FMs live up to their promise, AI might
	see far wider commercial use. As researchers studying the ramifications on society, we believe FMs
	will lead the way in massive changes. They are closely managed for the time being, so we should
	have time to comprehend their implications before they become a major concern.-->

								Collaborated with a group of students to design an interactive educational simulation program. The program simulated a varying number of characters who would wander around a "forest" represented by a grid. The characters would shift their location in the grid one box at a time until they moved into the same grid. The students would have to predict how long the characters would take to meet up. This program included graphics for the characters and trees, as well as different music that played for the main menu and while the simulation was running.

					<h1>Photo Encryption</h1>
					<table class='slide-table white-text'>
						<tr>
							<td>
								Independently designed and coded a program to implement a new variation of encryption using photos. The program utilizes symmetic encryption to split up the starting image into 3 separate images. To retrieve the message, the pictures can be recombined and using the symmetric key, will decode the message from inside the picture. To insert the message into the photo, the program uses the initialization vector to randomize which pixel the program will start adding the ASCII integer equivalent for each character of the message. So far this only works with PNG format images, as they use lossless compression. <a href='https://github.com/kolidesa/photo-encryption' class='center'>Github link to code</a>
